# This is an application for the VP course. The app showcases a game called CopsVsRobbers. The game features 1 policeman, 2 robbers and a businessman. The objective of the game is for the policeman to catch and kill as many robbers as he can. The policeman shoots at the robbers and gets a point for each kill. On every fifth kill, the speed of the robbers is incremented by 5. If at any point the policeman shoots the businessman, or one of the robbers manages to get away (moves to the bottom of the screen) the game ends.
